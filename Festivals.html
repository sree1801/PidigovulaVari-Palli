      <h3>Festivals:</h3>
      <p>1) Ganesh Chaturthi:</p>
      <p>
        Ganesh Chaturthi is a festival particularly beloved by the village's youngsters and is celebrated in September.
        Preparations begin a week in advance, with young villagers gathering to plan the festivities. They visit every
        home to collect contributions for the celebrations and then purchase an idol of Lord Ganesha.
      </p>
      <p>
        The festival lasts for three days. On the first day, the entire village comes together to perform poojas for
        Lord Ganesha, followed by a night filled with fun and socializing. The second day is dedicated to sports and
        games,
        including cricket and kabaddi, with prizes awarded to winners and runners-up, fostering a spirit of friendly
        competition. The third day culminates in the immersion of the Ganesha idol. This event is marked by exuberant
        joy,
        with villagers throwing colors at each other, dancing to traditional music played on drums, tablas, and flutes,
        and celebrating with unrestrained enthusiasm. According to Shashank, a local resident, the night of the
        immersion
        is unparalleled in its sheer joy and communal spirit, making it a highlight of village life.

      <p>2) Ganga Jathara:</p>
      <p>
        Ganga Jathara is one of the most prominent festivals in the region, celebrated a week before Ugadi, the Hindu
        New Year. This festival spans two days, typically on Sunday and Monday, and is marked by deep devotion and
        community
        participation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every family in the village procures a ram lamb to offer to Goddess GangaDevi. Regardless of their commitments,
        all family members come together to partake in the festivities. The Ganga Jathara, held annually around March or
        April, is dedicated to the village Goddess, Gangamma. Villagers believe that Goddess Gangamma is their
        protector,
        and thousands of people from neighboring regions of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu gather to celebrate this event.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sunday is a day filled with joyous reunions, where relatives and family members decorate their homes and the ram
        lamb, performing various poojas. The most significant rituals occur early Monday morning, around 4-5 AM, when
        the entire village simultaneously offers their prayers and sacrifices to the Goddess. This communal worship
        continues until about 7 AM and is considered the most joyful part of the festival. Following the rituals,
        families take
        the meat back to their homes, cook, and share a sumptuous feast with their relatives, creating cherished
        memories
        and strengthening their bonds.
